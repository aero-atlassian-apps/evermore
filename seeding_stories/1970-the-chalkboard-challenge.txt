September, 1970. 
My first real job. 
A literature teacher at Bronx High. 
I was so nervous… 
I think I polished my shoes three times that morning. 

I walked into that classroom… 
and it felt like walking into a lion's den. 
Thirty teenagers… 
all of them looking at me like I was a complete joke. 
One kid in the back was literally asleep before I even said hello. 

I picked up the chalk… 
and my hand was shaking just a little bit. 
I wrote my name on the board… 
MR. FOX. 

Then I turned around and said, 
"Today… we're going to talk about why stories matter. 
Because your life is a story… 
and if you don't write it… 
someone else will write it for you."

The kid in the back woke up. 
The room went quiet. 
And for the next forty-five minutes… 
I wasn't just a nervous twenty-five-year-old anymore. 
I was a teacher. 

We talked about dreams… 
about struggle… 
about finding your voice. 
I realized that these kids didn't just need facts… 
they needed to know that someone believed their stories were worth telling. 

When the bell rang… 
nobody moved for a second. 
The kid in the back… his name was Jimmy… 
he walked past my desk and said, "Not bad, Mr. Fox. Not bad." 

That was enough for me. 
I went home that day with chalk dust all over my suit… 
and a smile I couldn't get rid of. 
I knew then… 
that the classroom was my true home.
