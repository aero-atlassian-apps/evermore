1972. 
The year I met your grandmother, Margaret. 
It was a rainy Friday night… 
and Uncle Alaa had dragged me to this basement jazz club in Harlem. 
He said, "Arthur, you need to stop reading books and start living them!"

The room was full of smoke and the sound of a saxophone that could break your heart. 
And then… I saw her. 
She was sitting at a small table by the stage… 
reading a book. 
A book! At a jazz club! 

I told Alaa, "I have to talk to her." 
He laughed and said, "Go, my friend. Fortune favors the brave."

I walked over… 
feeling like an idiot. 
I said, "Excuse me… but isn't it too loud to read in here?" 

She looked up… 
and she had these eyes that looked right through you. 
She smiled and said, "It's never too loud for a good story. 
Besides… the music makes the words dance."

We talked until the band stopped playing. 
We talked about Dickens… 
about the city… 
about the way the rain looks on the windows in autumn. 

By the time we walked out into the cool night air… 
everything felt different. 
The streetlights looked brighter. 
The city felt softer. 

I walked her to the subway… 
and she gave me a small piece of paper with her name and number. 
"Call me, Arthur Fox," she said. 

I didn't wait until the next day. 
I think I called her that Monday… 
and we were married two years later. 
Uncle Alaa was my best man, of course. 
He kept telling everyone, "I'm the one who found her! I'm the architect of this love!" 

He was right, in a way. 
If it weren't for that jazz club… 
and that rainy night… 
the best parts of my story might never have been written.
