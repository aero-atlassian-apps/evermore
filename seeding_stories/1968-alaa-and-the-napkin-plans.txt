A year later… 1968. 
I was working a few odd jobs… 
trying to make ends meet and still wandering the city. 
That's when I walked into a little cafe in the West Village… 
and my life changed forever. 

I sat down at a corner table… 
trying to write some poetry, I think. 
And then I heard this booming voice: 
"Brother! You look far too serious for such a beautiful Tuesday!"

I looked up… 
and there was this tall, charismatic Moroccan man… 
grinning like he'd just won the lottery. 
That was your Uncle Alaa. 

He didn't ask to sit. 
He just pulled out a chair and sat. 
"I am Alaa. I have ten ideas for a business… 
and I need an educated man like you to help me pick the best one!"

Before I could say anything… 
he grabbed a stack of napkins… 
and started drawing. 
Circles… arrows… boxes… 
he was talking about imports… exports… 
bringing the flavors of Morocco to the streets of New York. 

He had so much energy… 
so much belief in things that didn't exist yet. 
We spent four hours in that cafe. 
The owner had to ask us to leave. 

By the time we walked out… 
I wasn't just a stranger to him anymore. 
I was his "partner." 
He said, "Arthur, we are going to build empires!" 

We never did build those empires… 
not out of brick and stone, anyway. 
But we built a friendship that stood for fifty years. 
He taught me that sometimes… 
the best business you can ever be in… 
is the business of being a good friend.
