It was 1967. 
I was twenty-two years old… 
fresh out of college and full of big ideas. 
I packed my entire life into one brown leather suitcase… 
and took the bus from my small town straight to Port Authority.

I remember stepping out onto the sidewalk… 
the noise… the steam rising from the vents… 
the buildings that looked like they were trying to touch the stars. 
I felt so small… 
but I felt like I finally belonged somewhere. 

I didn't have a job yet. 
I didn't have a place to live, really. 
Just a few dollars and a hunger to see the world. 
I walked until my feet hurt… 
past the neon signs of Times Square… 
down into the Village.

People were everywhere. 
Artists… musicians… students… 
everyone was looking for something. 
And I realized… 
I wasn't just moving to a city. 
I was moving into a new chapter of my life. 

It was loud… it was fast… 
and it was exactly where I needed to be.
That first night… I shared a hot dog with a stranger on a bench… 
and he told me, "Kid, New York doesn't give you anything… 
you have to take it."

I never forgot those words. 
I was ready to take on the world.
And New York… 
well, New York was ready for me.
