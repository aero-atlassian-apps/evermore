It was the summer of 1986. 
The air in Mexico City was thick, hot, and electric. 
I had saved up for three years to be there for the World Cup with my best friend, Alaa.

Alaa—or "Uncle Alaa" as everyone calls him now—was practically bursting with pride. 
Being Moroccan, he had this unshakeable belief that his team would do something historic. 
I remember him in the stands, draped in the red and green flag, shouting until his voice was hoarse.

And he was right! 
Morocco was in Group F, the "Group of Death" with England, Poland, and Portugal. 
Nobody gave them a chance, but they played with such heart. 
I'll never forget the day they beat Portugal 3-1 to top the group. 
They were the first African team to ever win a group at the World Cup. 
Alaa and I danced in the streets of Monterrey that night with people from all over the world.

Then we made our way to the Estadio Azteca for that legendary Argentina vs England match.
We were sitting right there when Maradona leapt into the air for the "Hand of God." 
Alaa turned to me and said, "Arthur, that man is either a genius or a thief, but he's definitely a legend."

Just minutes later, we saw that second goal—the "Goal of the Century." 
Maradona danced past everyone as if they weren't even there. 
Alaa was speechless for once, just shaking his head in awe.

I came home with a sunburnt face, a heart full of stories, and a deep respect for Alaa's intuition. 
Mexico '86 wasn't just about the goals... 
it was about seeing Alaa's homeland shock the world and witnessing Maradona's magic. 
It proved that even the smallest teams can stand tall on the biggest stage.
And Alaa? He never let me forget he was right about Morocco.
